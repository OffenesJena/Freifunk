# Reverse Engineering Freifunk

The aim of the 'Reverse-Engineering Freifunk' project is to build a nice Freifunk distribution for both free people and free sensor applications in a world of 'enough flash storage on every WLAN node' ;)

Currently this project is build for:
* [OpenWRT Chaos Calmer](http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/history) as a base distribution
* [ALIX 2C2 boards](http://www.pcengines.ch/alix2c2.htm) with enough space on a CF card
* 2x Atheros AR5213A WLAN chipsets (ath5k)
